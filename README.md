# Library

Library is a web application that allows users to keep track of their book collection. Users can add new books, including details such as the title, author, number of pages, and whether they have read the book or not. The application provides a convenient way to manage and organize personal libraries.

## Usage

1. Open the Library application in a web browser.
2. The main page displays a header with the title of the library.
3. Click the "Add New Book" button to add a new book to the library.
4. The "Add New Book" form will appear, prompting you to enter the book's details.
   - Enter the title of the book in the "Title" field.
   - Enter the author's name in the "Author" field.
   - Specify the number of pages in the book in the "Pages" field.
   - Check the "Have you read this book?" checkbox if you have read the book.
   - Click the "Submit" button to add the book to the library.
   - Click the "Close" button to cancel and close the form.
5. The added books will be displayed in a table on the main page.
   - Each row represents a book and contains columns for the book's title, author, pages, and read status.
   - The "Read" status column displays a checkmark if the book has been read.
6. You can continue adding new books by clicking the "Add New Book" button and filling out the form.
7. To update the read status of a book, check or uncheck the checkbox in the "Read" column.
8. To remove a book from the library, you can delete the corresponding row in the table by using the built-in functionality of your web browser.
